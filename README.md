The documents for the Open Source Job Search Engine Project.

The idea of the Open Source Job Search Engine is to make it free but to restrict that only companies can place job ads and also to verify that they are real companies. Additionally with the data collected reports can be presented so that job seekers can plan what to do next in their careers.
