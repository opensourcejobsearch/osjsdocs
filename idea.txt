The idea of the Open Source Job Search Engine is to make it free but to restrict that only companies can place job ads and also to verify that they are real companies.  Additionally with the data collected reports can be presented so that job seekers can plan what to do next in their careers.

For Employers:
- In a clear interface they can see which job seekers meet all the selection criteria.

For Job Seekers:
- Can receive an e-mail when an employer post a job.
- Can trust the information that they see, for example if the ad says that it is from a "Big company", that information can be trusted.
- The idea is that job seekers minimize the effort in applying to a job, sometimes a person can be discouraged to search for more jobs if it takes too much time. So the idea is that at the beginning a list of selection criteria items appear and the job seeker just checks which of them are true and then later the Employer decides to which job seekers to ask the resume.

The idea is to make it available on iPhone, iPad and Android only, no on the web because of bots, do you know what is a bot ? It is a piece of software that keeps connecting to a web page.

The idea is make it open source because it will be free.  The only intention is a social benefit.  The idea is to make it like Mozilla made Firefox, like that.  How does  that idea sound to you ?  Any comments ?

(This idea can be changed according to the feedback from the community).
